Create an agent that interprets the warning message of the sensor output to create some hypothesis about what could cause the warning. The agent should use methods like:
-web scraping: check the local weather
-check the context: info about the sensor.
-check the history (all or just the warnings, to decide how to do)

## TO CHANGE
- right now the agent doesn't really know where the temperature it receive comes from. Need to add context in a way or the other.

- I don't like how the functions in my_warnings.py are structured.

## IMPROVEMENTS
- The tools have a method description. where it is described what they do and wahat they need as input. This method is used to describe the tool to an LLM. Instead, write a proper docstring and pass it to the LLM.
