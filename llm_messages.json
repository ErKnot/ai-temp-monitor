    "The warning indicates that the temperature of 6.8\n\u00b0C is below the lower threshold of 17.0\n\u00b0C. Based on the provided context, which includes temperature data for Brussels over the past week (2025-03-11 to 2025-03-17), the current low temperature is consistent with the recent trend of low average daily temperatures in Brussels. This suggests that the warning is likely due to normal seasonal temperature variations in Brussels.",
    "The warnings indicate that the temperature is significantly below the lower threshold of 17.0 \u00b0C. The current temperatures reported are 6.8 \u00b0C and 7.0 \u00b0C. Given the context, which shows average temperatures in Brussels for the week leading up to the warning dates are also very low (ranging from 3.1\u00b0C to 6.8\u00b0C), a likely cause is simply that it is a period of unusually cold weather in Brussels. There may be some external cause that produce such cold weather.",
    "The warning indicates that the temperature (6.8\u00b0C) is below the defined lower threshold (17.0\u00b0C). Considering the provided context about the 'Week Temperatur Tool' action in Brussels, and the agent's response showing average temperatures for the past week, the possible cause is that the current temperature is genuinely low for the time of year or that the lower threshold is wrongly configured. It is also possible that there is an issue with the temperature sensor.",
    "The warnings indicate that the temperature is below the lower threshold of 17.0 \u00b0C. The Orchestrator indicates that the 'Week Temperature Tool' was used with 'Brussels' as input. Reviewing the agent response, the average temperatures for the past week (2025-03-11 to 2025-03-17) in Brussels were all significantly below 17.0 \u00b0C, ranging from 3.1 \u00b0C to 6.8 \u00b0C. It's probable the temperature sensor is correctly reporting a consistently cold ambient temperature. Therefore the cause of the warnings is likely normal operation under cold conditions in Brussels.",
    "The warning indicates that the temperature (6.8\u00b0C) is below the expected lower threshold (17.0\u00b0C). Based on the context, the 'Week Temperatur Tool' was used for Brussels, and the agent response shows average temperatures for the past week all significantly lower than the current lower threshold. A possible cause is a misconfiguration of the temperature thresholds or that the current temperature is unusually low compared to the thresholds, but consistent with recent temperatures."
