    "The warning indicates that the temperature of 6.8\u00b0C is below the defined lower threshold of 17.0\u00b0C. Based on the provided context, the 'Week Temperatur Tool' was used to retrieve the average temperature for Brussels for the week leading up to the warning. The agent response shows a decreasing trend in average temperatures, with the last three days having significantly lower temperatures (6.8\u00b0C, 4.5\u00b0C, and 4.1\u00b0C). Possible causes include a sudden cold snap, a malfunctioning temperature sensor, or an incorrect lower threshold setting.",
    "The temperature recorded on 2025-03-14 is 6.8\u00b0C, which is below the lower threshold of 17.0\u00b0C. Reviewing the historical temperature data for Brussels from the previous week shows a gradual decrease in average temperature, with the most recent days (2025-03-12 and 2025-03-13) showing temperatures of 4.5\u00b0C and 4.1\u00b0C respectively. The warning suggests a potential issue related to temperature regulation or a genuine cold weather event in Brussels.",
    "The warning indicates that the temperature (6.8\u00b0C) is below the expected lower threshold (17.0\u00b0C). Considering the context, the 'Week Temperatur Tool' was used to retrieve the average temperature for Brussels. The data shows a decreasing trend in average temperatures over the past week, culminating in significantly lower temperatures on March 11th (6.8\u00b0C), 12th (4.5\u00b0C), and 13th (4.1\u00b0C). Possible causes include a cold weather snap in Brussels during that period, a malfunctioning temperature sensor, or an incorrect lower threshold setting.",
    "The warning indicates that the temperature (6.8 \u00b0C) is below the lower threshold (17.0 \u00b0C). Based on the provided context, the orchestrator is running a 'Week Temperature Tool' for Brussels. The agent's response shows the average temperatures for the past week. The temperature on 2025-03-11 was 6.8\u00b0C, 2025-03-12 was 4.5\u00b0C and 2025-03-13 was 4.1\u00b0C. A possible cause is that the temperature is genuinely low compared to the threshold. Another is that the threshold is misconfigured, because the temperature is expected in Brussels in march."
